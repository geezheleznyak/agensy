# Changelog

All notable changes to AGENSY are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Convention: each entry names the specific files changed (e.g., `framework/architecture-principles.md`) so readers can trace what `git log` would confirm.

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- `README.md`: removed "full maturity" overclaim in two places — replaced with honest viability framing ("works across real domains", "built by the same process it teaches")

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- `framework/architecture-principles.md`, `framework/system-contracts.md`, `framework/system-architecture.md`,
  `framework/genesis-protocol.md`, `framework/command-lifecycle.md`, `framework/inter-vault-protocol.md`,
  `framework/claude-md-template.md`, `framework/universal-commands/arc.md`, `framework/universal-commands/question-bank.md`,
  `framework/universal-commands/what-next.md`: replaced all `synthesis-meta/...` path references with
  `[AGENSY_PATH]/...` and conceptual "lives in synthesis-meta" with "lives in agensy"

### Changed

- `framework/system-contracts.md` §1: trimmed from 3 verbose paragraphs to 3 bullet one-liners
  + pointer to `architecture-principles.md`; added cross-reference to §5 pointing to `architecture-principles.md` §4
- `framework/architecture-principles.md` §4: added cross-reference to `system-contracts.md` §5
- `CHANGELOG.md`: added convention note — entries should name specific files changed

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Gitignored `.obsidian/app.json` and `.obsidian/appearance.json` — empty files, user-specific Obsidian state with no framework value

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Command count corrected from 16 to 17 in `docs/global-claude-md.md` and `README.md` (`/quick-check` was missing from both lists)
- Repository structure comment in `README.md` updated: `16 protocol files + 3 legacy` → `17 + 2`
- `CHANGELOG.md` added (versioning infrastructure was present in `COMPATIBILITY.md` but CHANGELOG was missing)

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-04

### Initial release

- 17 universal command protocols (16 user-invoked + 1 automatic sub-protocol: `quick-check`)
- Two-zone architecture (reference substrate + synthesis core)
- Three-tier note system with graduation logic
- Four vault types: accumulation, training, domain, expression
- Four intellectual style presets: adversarial, dialectical, contemplative, constructive
- Genesis Protocol (7-question vault bootstrapping, 4 phases, 12 documents)
- Cross-vault bridge architecture with shared `system-state.md`
- Command lifecycle with 4 trigger types (automatic, milestone, session, analytical)
- Session state system (`memory/session-state.md` + `memory/note-index.md`)
- Six example vault configs: theoria, bellum, logos, politeia, oeconomia, historia
- Python validation tools: `vault-linter.py`, `framework-verify.py`
